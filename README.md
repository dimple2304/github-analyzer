GitHub Profile Analyzer API

Ever wondered how to pull meaningful insights from a GitHub profile beyond just the bio? This project does exactly that — give it a username, and it fetches their public GitHub data, extracts useful stats, and saves everything to a MySQL database for later retrieval.

Built with Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and the GitHub REST API.


What it does
> Analyze any GitHub user just by passing their username
> Pulls and stores things like follower count, total stars, top languages, account age, most starred repo, and more
> If you analyze the same user again, it updates their record instead of creating a duplicate
> Supports pagination when listing all stored profiles
> Comes with a simple HTML frontend so you can test it without opening Postman
> Has a rate limiter built in so the API doesn't get hammered
> Supports a GitHub token to avoid the 60 req/hour limit on unauthenticated requests

Getting Started

1. Clone the repo

bashgit clone https://github.com/dimple2304/github-analyzer.git
cd github-analyzer

2. Install dependencies

bashnpm install

3. Set up environment variables

bashcp .env.example .env

Open .env and fill in your values:

envPORT=3000

# MySQL connection
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=github_analyzer

# Optional but highly recommended — without this you're limited to 60 requests/hour
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

> To get a GitHub token: go to github.com/settings/tokens → Generate new token (classic) → you don't need any special scopes for public data.



4. Set up the database

The easiest way — just create the database and let the app handle the rest:

sqlCREATE DATABASE github_analyzer;

The table gets created automatically when the server starts. Or if you prefer doing it manually:

bashmysql -u root -p github_analyzer < schema.sql

5. Start the server

bash# Development (auto-restarts on changes)
npm run dev

# Production
npm start

Server runs at http://localhost:3000


API Endpoints

Method      Endpoint                    What it does

Deploying to Railway
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to railway.app → New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo
3. Add a MySQL database to your project
4.Copy the MySQL credentials Railway gives you into your environment variables
5. Add NODE_ENV=production and all the DB_* variables in the Variables tab
6. Railway picks up npm start automatically — no extra config needed



Testing with Postman
Import postman/GitHub_Profile_Analyzer.postman_collection.json into Postman and update the base_url variable to your deployed URL. All endpoints are pre-configured and ready to run.
